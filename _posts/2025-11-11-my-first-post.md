# Kickoff: Building My Research Blog  

Today I officially launched my research blog! 🎉  
I’ll use this space to record my progress, from building a multimodal advertising dataset with the BFI to exploring visual and cultural patterns through machine vision.  

My next goal is to post short reflections on the tools I’m using — starting with **YOLO**, **BLIP**, and **CLIP** — and what they reveal about the representation of people and spaces in UK advertisements.  

Stay tuned!
