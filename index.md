# Welcome to My Research Blog

Hello! I’m **Shihan Liu**, a researcher in digital humanities and machine vision.

Here I’ll share updates from my PhD journey at King’s College London and my collaborative work with the British Film Institute (BFI).  
Stay tuned for posts about data visualization, algorithmic seeing, and cultural representation.
